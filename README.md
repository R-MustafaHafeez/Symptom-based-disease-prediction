# Symptom-based-disease-prediction
This project is about disease prediction based on the symptoms given by user as an input. We
are using Supervised Learning in which multiple algorithms can be used but we applied Decision
Tree technique. Decision Tree classifies and predict the disease in the data set of Symptoms
based Disease Symptoms and Diseases are given in our case. We have 41 unique diseases which
is our target variable and 17 columns of symptoms that are independent features. Our dataset
will look like the given figure below. It is also available on Kaggle.
